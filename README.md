# Python Base Project

This repository serves as the fundamental starting point for your Python projects.

## Setting Up Your Environment

To streamline your development environment, follow these steps:

1. Run the `setup_dev_env.sh` script in your preferred shell using the command `./setup_dev_env.sh`.

2. **Development Dependencies:**
   - We've integrated `pyenv` into the workflow, allowing you to specify your project's local Python version (currently set to 3.9.5).
   - Utilize `pipenv` for an efficient approach to installing and managing project dependencies.
